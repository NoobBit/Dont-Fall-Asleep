# Don’t-Fall-Asleep
Don't fall asleep! is a program I made to make your computer not fall asleep while you keep it on. Basically, if you’re running an autoclicker, or in a online meeting or something else this can be used to keep your computer on. How it works is by moving the mouse up and down every 5 seconds, which would keep the computer awake as long as you want. This allows you to relax in boring meetings, get billions of cookies, or something else.
